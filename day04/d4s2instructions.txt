--- Part Two ---

An Elf just remembered one more important detail: 

******* the two adjacent matching digits are not part of a larger group of matching digits.*************

Given this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:

112233 meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.
123444 no longer meets the criteria (the repeated 44 is part of a larger group of 444).
111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double 22).
How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?

Your puzzle input is still 123257-647015.
